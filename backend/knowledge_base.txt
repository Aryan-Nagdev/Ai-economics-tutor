CHAPTER: OLIGOPOLY (AQA ECONOMICS)

MEANING OF OLIGOPOLY:
Oligopoly is a market structure where a small number of large firms dominate the market. These firms have a high degree of market power and are highly interdependent, meaning each firm’s actions affect the decisions of others.

MARKET CONCENTRATION AND CONCENTRATION RATIOS:
Oligopoly markets are identified using concentration ratios. A concentration ratio measures the combined market share of the largest firms in the industry.
For example, a five-firm concentration ratio shows the percentage of total market output produced by the five largest firms. High concentration ratios indicate oligopoly.

INTERDEPENDENCE:
Firms in oligopoly are interdependent. Before changing price or output, firms must consider how rival firms might react. This creates uncertainty because firms cannot predict competitors’ responses with certainty.

PRICE AND NON-PRICE COMPETITION:
Oligopolistic firms may compete through price competition or non-price competition.
Non-price competition includes advertising, branding, product differentiation, loyalty schemes, and customer service. This helps firms gain market share without triggering price wars.

COLLUSIVE AND NON-COLLUSIVE OLIGOPOLY:
Non-collusive oligopoly occurs when firms act independently without agreements.
Collusive oligopoly occurs when firms cooperate, often by forming cartels, to control prices or output and increase joint profits.

CARTELS:
A cartel is a formal agreement between firms to fix prices, restrict output, or divide markets. Cartels aim to increase joint profits but are usually illegal in many countries.

JOINT PROFIT MAXIMISATION:
In collusive oligopoly, firms behave like a monopoly by producing at the output level where joint profits are maximised. This results in higher prices and lower output, leading to potential welfare losses for consumers.

KINKED DEMAND CURVE THEORY:
The kinked demand curve model explains price stability in oligopoly.
Firms believe that if they raise prices, competitors will not follow, leading to a large loss in market share.
If firms cut prices, competitors will match the price cut, resulting in little gain in market share.
Therefore, demand is more elastic above the current price and more inelastic below it, leading to price rigidity.

ADVANTAGES OF OLIGOPOLY:
- Economies of scale leading to lower average costs
- Greater investment in research and development
- Innovation and product variety
- Potentially higher quality products

DISADVANTAGES OF OLIGOPOLY:
- Higher prices for consumers
- Reduced consumer choice
- Risk of collusion
- Potential inefficiency due to lack of competition

VIDEO LECTURE SUMMARY 1 (Ec19ljjvlCI):
The video explains oligopoly using real-world examples such as supermarkets, banks, and technology firms.
It highlights the importance of concentration ratios and shows how a few firms dominate market share.
The lecture emphasizes interdependence and explains why firms avoid aggressive price competition.
Non-price competition such as advertising and branding is identified as a key feature of oligopoly markets.

---------------------------------
VIDEO LECTURE SUMMARY 2 (Z_S0VA4jKes):
This lecture focuses on the kinked demand curve model.
It explains why prices in oligopoly markets tend to be stable over time.
The video shows that firms fear price rises more than price cuts due to competitor reactions.
Elastic and inelastic sections of the demand curve are explained clearly using diagrams.

EXAMINATION TIPS (FROM PDF + VIDEOS):
- Always begin by defining oligopoly clearly
- Use concentration ratios as evidence
- Explain interdependence between firms
- Use real-world examples such as supermarkets or airlines
- Draw and explain the kinked demand curve
- Mention both advantages and disadvantages
- Use correct economic terminology
